I am a Lecturer in Genomics Data Science in the SFI Centre for Research Training in Genomics Data Science at the National University of Ireland, Galway. I have a PhD in bioinformatics (pathogen genomics) and have also worked as a bioinformatician in industry. My research interests include microbial genomics, metagenomics, population genomics and structural variation discovery. My teaching interests include teaching methods to aid reproducibility (version control, workflow managers, containers, FAIR data principles) as well as teaching programming and bioinformatics analysis.
